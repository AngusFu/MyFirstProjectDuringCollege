# a-memory-of-college
This just keeps a memory when I was in college and first met with PHP and HTML, JavaScript/jQuery.

Look at those code, just in a mess. Every time I looked at these code, I would sigh, 'OMG, why I wrote such sh*t in 2014!'

However, I spent nearly a month, coding from 9am to 1am, this is the only reason I kept my code.
